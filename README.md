# A blank HTML file generator. (Python)
A Python script for creating a blank, barebones HTML file, with your choice of file name. Sweet!
<hr>
The big idea for this project is to learn to extend the Linux touch command to name a file to be used as a web page, and to automatically insert basic, barebones html code, a skeleton of a web page.

You can give your page any name you want, and use any suffix you want (html, php, etc.).

This was a fun project for me to complete! I learned a lot about Python while working on this, as well as how Python interacts with the command line. I am not a professional programmer; just do it as a hobby, so, it makes the finished project all the more rewarding! Hopefully it will be of good use for someone!
